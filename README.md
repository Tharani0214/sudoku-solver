Sudoku Solver Application
This project is a Sudoku Solver built using React.js. It provides features to input, validate, solve, and get hints for a Sudoku puzzle. The application ensures the grid follows Sudoku rules and uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle.

Features
Input Grid

A 9x9 grid to input Sudoku numbers.
Each cell accepts digits between 1-9 or remains empty.
Validation

Validates whether the current grid configuration adheres to Sudoku rules.
Displays an error message if invalid.
Solving Algorithm

Uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle.
Displays a success message if the solution is found or an error if unsolvable.
Hints

Displays possible values for each empty cell based on the current grid.
Reset and Clear

Clears the entire grid for fresh input.
How It Works
1. Validation Logic
The Sudoku grid is validated using these rules:

Row Validation:
Each row should contain unique digits (1-9).

Column Validation:
Each column should contain unique digits (1-9).

Subgrid Validation:
Each 3x3 subgrid should contain unique digits (1-9).

2. Solving Algorithm
The backtracking algorithm recursively tries filling empty cells with valid digits.

Steps:
Find an empty cell in the grid.
Try placing each digit (1-9) in the cell.
Check if the digit placement is valid based on Sudoku rules.
If valid, proceed to solve the next empty cell recursively.
If no valid placement exists, backtrack to the previous cell.

Usage
Input the Grid
Fill the grid with known Sudoku values.

Validate the Grid
Click "Validate" to check if the grid follows Sudoku rules.

Solve the Puzzle
Click "Solve" to auto-solve the puzzle using the backtracking algorithm.

Get Hints
Click on any empty cell to get possible values for that cell or click "Show Hints" to get hints for all empty cells.

Clear the Grid
Click "Clear" to reset the grid.
